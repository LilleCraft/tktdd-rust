## Meet Rust

[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) is a general purpose programming language with an emphasis on expressiveness and safety.

### First tour

Open the [try site](https://play.integer32.com/) and try each piece of code bellow, step by step

#### Binding

Variable declaration and assignement use `let` binding :

```Rust
fn main() {
    let greeting: &str = "hello";
    // prefix variable with _ avoid warnings from compiler for unused variable
    let _greeting = "hello"; //Rust do inference
    let score: i16 = 10;

    println!("{} with {} kisses",greeting, score);
}
```

Bidings are immutables by default, but you can make them mutable by adding `mut` in front of the variable name.
In addition to allowing this value to change, `mut` conveys intent to future readers of the code by indicating that other parts of the code will be changing this variable value.

```Rust
fn main() {
    let mut score = 10;
    println!("{} points", score);
    score = 11;
    println!("{} points", score);
}
```

However, you may create a new binding of the same name which shadows the previous binding :

```Rust
fn main() {
    let greeting = "hello";
    println!("{}", greeting);
    let greeting = "bye";
    println!("{}", greeting);
}
```

#### Ownership

When you assign a variable to another some language _copy_ the value (like C++), some other _copy_ the reference (like python). Rust use a different mechanism.
Rust’s central feature to manage memory is ownership. Although the feature is straightforward to explain, it has deep implications for the rest of the language.

First, let’s take a look at the ownership rules. Keep these rules in mind :

- Each value in Rust has a variable that’s called its owner.
- There can only be one owner at a time. So when you _use_ a variable you **move** ownership.
- When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.

Assigment move ownership of a variable :

```Rust
fn main() {
    let greeting = String::from("hello"); // in fact "hello" was a string slice
    let greeting2 = greeting; // ownership move to greeting2
    println!("{}", greeting); // error greeting does not exist any more
}
```

Pass a function's parameter move ownership of a variable :

```Rust
fn main() {
   let greeting = String::from("hello");
   println!("{}", add_world(greeting)); // ownership move to addWorld function
   println!("{}", greeting); // error greeting does not exist any more
}

fn add_world (s: String) -> String {
    return s + &(String::from(" world"));
}
```

To reuse variable, you can clone them :

```Rust
fn main() {
    let greeting = String::from("hello"); // in fact "hello" was a string slice
    let greeting2 = greeting.clone(); // make a copy of greeting
    println!("{}", greeting); // error greeting does not exist any more
}
```

You can also **borrow** a reference to the variable :

```Rust
fn main() {
   let greeting = String::from("hello");
   let greeting2 = &greeting; // &greeting  lets us create a reference that refers to the value of greeting but does not own it
   println!("{}", greeting2);
   println!("{}", greeting); // works !
}
```

```Rust
fn main() {
   let greeting = String::from("hello");
   let greeting2 = add_world(&greeting); // &greeting  lets us create a reference that refers to the value of greeting but does not own it
   println!("{}", greeting2);
   println!("{}", greeting); // works !
}

fn add_world (s: &String) -> String {
    let s_world = s.clone() + &(String::from(" world")); // +infix operator (+) concat String with &str (string slice)
    s_world // implicit return
}
```

This introduce some restrictions like a borrowed content cannot be moved :

```Rust
fn main() {
   let greeting = String::from("hello");
   let greeting2 = add_all(&greeting);
}

fn add_all (s: &String) -> String {
    let s_world = *s + &(String::from(" all")); // compilation error
    s_world
}
```

You can notice that `&` give a reference to a value, the opposite is dereference operator is accomplished by `*`

There is an exception to the move of ownership mechanism, the type of the variable implement the _Copy_ trait. This is the case by default for primitive like _bool_, integer types (_i16_, _u32_, ...), floating types (_f64_, ...), _char_, ... and tuples which only contain types with Copy trait : _(i32, u16)_ does Copy, but _(i32, String)_ doesn't Copy

```Rust
fn main() {
    let score = 10;
    let score2 = score; // score2 copy score
    println!("{}", score); // print 10
}
```

If it is a new concept for you, you should [read this](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-rust/9781491927274/ch04.html)

#### Types

The type system is completely "sound" by default. This means that, as long as your code compiles fine in safe mode, every type guarantees that it's not lying about itself. In a conventional, best-effort type system, just because the type says it's e.g. "an integer that's never null", doesn't mean it's actually never null. In contrast, a pure Rust program has no null bugs.

This code gives a copilation time error :

```Rust
fn main() {
    let reference_to_nothing = dangle();
}

fn dangle() -> &String { // dangle returns a reference to a String

    let s = String::from("hello"); // s is a new String

    &s // we return a reference to the String, s
} // Here, s goes out of scope, and is dropped. Its memory goes away.
```

Rust types can be inferred. The type system deduces the types for you even if you don't manually write them down.

```Rust
let greeting = "hello";
let score = 10;
```

Alias types can refer to a type by a different name. They'll be equivalent:

```Rust
type Score = i16;
let s1 : Score = 10;
```

Rust provides two list primitives : Array and Vector. Arrays are useful when you want your data allocated on the stack rather than the heap. Arrays are homogeneous, immutable, fixed length.

```Rust
    let heroes_array : [&str; 3] = ["Carl", "Rick", "Michonne"];
    let first = heroes_array[0]; // accessing first element
    let second = heroes_array[1];
```

A vector is a similar collection type provided by the standard library that is allowed to grow or shrink in size.

```Rust
    let heroes_vector : Vec<String> = vec![String::from("Carl"),String::from( "Rick"), String::from("Michonne")];
    let first = &heroes_vector[0];
    assert_eq!(first, "Carl");
    let middle = &heroes_vector[1..3];
    assert_eq!(middle, [ "Rick", "Michonne"]);
    let copy_heroes = heroes_vector.clone(); // clone heroes_vector which cannot be move because previously borrowed
    let mut more_heroes = vec![String::from("Negan")];
    more_heroes.extend(copy_heroes);// copy_heroes is moved and can't be used anymore
    assert_eq!(more_heroes, [ "Negan", "Carl", "Rick", "Michonne"]);
```

Product types

```Rust
/* Tuples are immutable, ordered, fix-sized at creation time heterogeneous */
let name_heart: (&str, i32) = ("Negan", 10);
type coord3d = (i32, i32, i32);
let warehouseCoord: coord3d = (1, 4, 18);

/* Records are immutable by default and fixed in field names and types */
struct Hero {
  heart: i32,
  name: String,

}
let negan = Hero { heart : 10, name : String::from("Negan")};
let name = String::from("Carl");
let carl = Hero {
    name, // punning
    heart: 10,
};
```

Variant types

```Rust
enum LifeVariant {
    Alive(Hero),
    Dead,
    Zombi
}

let how_is_Negan = LifeVariant::Alive(negan);
let how_is_Lori = LifeVariant::Dead;
```

Alive, Dead and Zombi are called "constructors" (or "tag"). A variant's constructors need to be capitalized. Type constructor may have parameters

Algebraic data types come with one of the most important features : **pattern matching**

```Rust
fn get_message(how_are_you: LifeVariant) -> String{
     match how_are_you {
      LifeVariant::Zombi => String::from("Aaaaaarg !"),
      LifeVariant::Dead => String::from("!!!"),
      LifeVariant::Alive(h) => String::from("Great! ") + &h.name + " is alive",
    }

};
assert_eq!(get_message(how_is_Negan), String::from("Great! Negan is alive"));
assert_eq!(get_message(how_is_Lori), String::from("!!!"));
```

For some use cases, when matching enums, match is awkward. `if let` is cleaner for some use case and in addition allows various failure options to be specified:

```Rust
let how_is_zombi = LifeVariant::Zombi;

fn get_message2(how_are_you: LifeVariant) -> String{
    // The `if let` construct reads: "if `let` destructures `how_are_you` into
    // `LifeVariant::Alive(h)`, evaluate the block (`{}`).
    if let LifeVariant::Alive(h) = how_are_you  {
         String::from("Great! ") + &h.name + " is alive"
    } else{
        String::from("No more hope")
    }
};
assert_eq!(get_message2(how_is_zombi), String::from("No more hope"));
```

#### Options

Rust itself doesn't permit the notion of null or undefined in safe code. This is a great thing, as it wipes out an entire category of bugs. No more undefined is not a function, and cannot access foo of undefined!

We represent the existence and nonexistence of a value by wrapping it with the option type. Here's its definition from the standard library:

```Rust
enum Option<T> {
   None,
   Some(T)
}
```

It means "a value of type option is either None (nothing) or that actual value wrapped in a Some".

Exemple :

```Rust
type Weapon =  Option<String>;

fn is_dangerous(w: Weapon) -> String {
  match w {
   None  => String::from("not dangerous"),
   Some(a) => String::from("is armed with a ") + &a,

  }
};

let unarmed: Weapon = None;
let knife: Weapon = Some(String::from("knife"));
assert_eq!(is_dangerous(unarmed), String::from("not dangerous"));
assert_eq!(is_dangerous(knife), String::from("is armed with a knife"));
```

There is a shorter way to [unwrap](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/option/enum.Option.html#method.unwrap_or) a value from an Option<T> in Rust :

```Rust
assert_eq!(unarmed.unwrap_or("not dangerous"), String::from("not dangerous"));
assert_eq!(knife.unwrap_or("not dangerous"), String::from("knife"));
```

#### Functions

Functions are declared with an expression

```Rust
 fn add (x:i32, y:i32) -> i32 {
      x+y
 }
 let add_lambda = |x: i32, y: i32| -> i32 {x + y}; // this is lambda syntax
 let add1 = |x| add(1, x); // You may use lambda to do partial application
 assert_eq!(add_lambda(1,2),add(1,2));
 assert_eq!(add1(2),add(1,2));
```

There is much more amazing features to know in Rust, we just focus here in those that you should use to solve the tennis kata (￣^￣)ゞ
