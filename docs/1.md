## Consideration about Points

#### Naive point attempt with a type alias

```Rust
type Point = i32;
```

This easily enables you to model some of the legal point values:

```Rust
let p : Point = 15;
let p : Point = 30;
```

It looks good so far, but how do you model love? It's not really an integer. Still, both players start with love, so it's intuitive to try to model love as 0 ...It's a hack, but it works. But your illegal values are not unrepresentable :

```Rust
let p : Point = 1000
let p : Point = -20
```

For a 32-bit integer, this means that we have four legal representations (0, 15, 30, 40), and 4,294,967,291 illegal representations of a tennis point. Clearly this doesn't meet the goal of making illegal states unrepresentable. ლ(ಠ_ಠლ)

#### Second point attempt with a variant

You may see that love, 15, 30, and 40 aren't numbers, but rather labels. No arithmetic is performed on them. It's easy to constrain the domain of points with a variant

```Rust
enum Point {
  Love,
  Fifteen,
  Thirty,
  Forty,
}
```

A Point value isn't a score. A score is a representation of a state in the game, with a point to each player.
You can model this with a record:

```Rust
 struct PointsData {
    player_one: Point,
    player_two: Point,
 }
```

Exemple

```Rust
let s1 = { player_one : Point::Love, player_two : Point::Love };
let s2 = { player_one : Point::Fifteen, player_two : Point::Love };
let s3 = { player_one : Point::Thirty, player_two : Point::Love };
```
