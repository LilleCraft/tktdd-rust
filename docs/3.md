## Designing score type

Now you have two distinct types, PointsData and FortyData, that keep track of the score at two different phases of a tennis game. You still need to model the remaining three phases, and somehow turn all of these into a single type. This is an undertaking that can be surprisingly complicated in C# or Java, but is trivial to do with a variant:

```Rust
enum Score {
  Points(PointsData),
  Forty(FortyData),
  Deuce,
  Advantage(Player),
  Game(Player),
}
```

As an example, the game starts with both players at love:

```Rust
let start_score: Score =
  Score::Points(PointsData { player_one : Point::Love, player_two : Point::Love });
}
```

PlayerOne has forty points, and PlayerTwo has thirty points, you can create this value:

```Rust
let anotherScore = Score::Forty({player : Player::PlayerTwo; other_player_point : Point::Thirty })
```

This model of the tennis score system enables you to express all legal values, while making illegal states unrepresentable.

```Rust
/* All exemple above don't work */
let impossible_score1 = Score::Points(PointsData {player_one: Point::Seven, player_two : Point::Eleven});
let impossible_score2 = Score::Points(PointsData {player_one: Point::Forty, player_two : Point::Forty});
let impossible_score3 = Score::Forty(FortyData {player: Player::PlayerTwo, other_player_point : Point::Forty });
```

These types govern what can be stated in the domain, but they don't provide any rules for how values can transition from one state to another.
